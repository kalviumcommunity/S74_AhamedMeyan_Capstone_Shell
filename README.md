# Shell

## Learn the Linux Terminal â€” The Interactive Way

**Shell** is a modern, web-based learning platform that helps you build real-world command-line skills through hands-on practice, structured modules, and built-in challenges.

## ðŸ§  Project Idea

Shell is designed to help users learn and master the Linux terminal in a fun, interactive, and engaging way. Instead of passively watching videos or reading docs, users can run real commands in a safe, built-in terminal while progressing through a carefully structured learning path. The platform combines guided tutorials, real-world exercises, gamification, and certification to make learning the terminal both effective and enjoyable.
